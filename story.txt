Emily left the Flughafen because there was no Klimaanlage.
And she saw a Porsche walking by in a Dirndel.
The Porsche is eating a Bratwurst.
Emily kept walking past the Ratkeller and Biergarten where many people where walking around in lederhose.
Emily's hund needed to take a drink so she stopped by the Hauptstrasse to rest for a minute.
Emily decided she wanted to meet her friends at the Biergarten.
One of Emily's friend was Mehlhase and she's bringing a Apfelkuchen.
But she decided to meet them somewhere else after a BMW crashed through the Biergarten like a Rammstein.
Emily friend was originally from Berlin and came from a noble family of eltz
Then Till Lindemann from Rammstein ran out of a baeckerei with a bag of brot!
Till's wettbewerbsfaehig spirit showed when he challenged everyone in the Biergarten to a drinking challenge.
But wettbewerbsfaehig was defeated when he couldn't keep his beer down.
