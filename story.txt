Emily left the Flughafen because there was no Klimaanlage.
And she saw a Porsche walking by in a Dirndel.
The Porsche is eating a Bratwurst.
Emily kept walking past the Ratkeller and Biergarten where many people where walking around in lederhose.
Emily's hund needed to take a drink so she stopped by the Hauptstrasse to rest for a minute.
Emily decided she wanted to meet her friends at the Biergarten.
One of Emily's friend was Mehlhase and she's bringing a Apfelkuchen.
But she decided to meet them somewhere else after a BMW crashed through the Biergarten like a Rammstein.
Emily friend was originally from Berlin and came from a noble family of eltz
Then Till Lindemann from Rammstein ran out of a baeckerei with a bag of brot!
Till's wettbewerbsfaehig spirit showed when he challenged everyone in the Biergarten to a drinking challenge.
A man in lederhosen walked up to Till with a thirsty look in his eye, ready to take him on.
Emily said "Brace yourself, Till. I am half Hund, half Porsche and half Rammstein... HUUUNDPOOOOORSCHERAMSTEIN!"
And then till purchased and took a large bite of apfelkuchen, knowing everything would be okay.
Till won the Wettbewerb, but was put by the police under Schloss in the Ratskeller of Schloss Eltz to sleep it all off.
Everything was going fine until Till got hammered and locked himself on the roof of Schloss Wernigerode, singing "I Came In Like a Wrecking Ball" as the authorities removed him.
In the end Emily ate her bratwurst with her hund.
In the morning, Emily bought Gebaecks for her and Till on her way to pick up Till from the police station.
